\chapter{System implementation}

\initial{T}he design phase of the Systems Engineering approach will be presented in the current chapter instead of the previous one since the focus of this phase was put in the software part, for the hardware one being too dependant on the existing UAV.
However, the final hardware assembly of the system in the working prototype will also be discussed at the end of the present chapter.
Also, the software design was a parallel process to the coding itself, and the functioning of the computer programs is better explained through real code snippets rather than pseudocode or block diagrams.
