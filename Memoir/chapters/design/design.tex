\chapter{System design}

\initial{A}s mentioned in Section \ref{sec:methodology}, the design of the Obstacle Collision Avoidance System will follow the Systems Engineering approach.
The main reason is that Systems Engineering provides some methods that prevent the errors with the highest consequences when the system to be designed is complex.
As explained by Rolls-Royce Global Chief of Systems Engineering \cite{beasley2015}:
\begin{quote}
	\itshape
	Systems Engineering collects and organises all the information needed to understand the whole problem, explores it from all angles, and then finds the most appropriate system solution.
\end{quote}

Furthermore, A key study published through INCOSE \cite{incoseuk2016} looked at the phase of detection of errors, and the consequent cost of fixing them.
Cost modelling was validated against a cross-industry range of defence and aerospace projects.
Figure \ref{fig:incose} shows the results of the study.

Hence, in the present chapter, some of the most relevant Systems Engineering tools from the NASA Systems Engineering Handbook \cite{nationalaeronauticsandspaceadministration2007} will be applied


\section{Requirements capture}

The design process for a system is requirement driven, since the requirements are what will define the cost, design, schedule\ldots\ % Space after \ldots
A requirement is a statement about or a characteristic of something that is needed.

Requirements can be derived from a variety of sources, like customer needs, stakeholders, regulations, procedures, constrains, etc.
However, for this project, customers and stakeholders will be disregarded (since none exist) and the motivation as stated in Section \ref{sec:motivation} will be used instead.

In the present section some requirements will be posed, but only those that directly apply to the OCAS subsystem or its interfaces, since the platform is considered to be completely functional prior to the introduction of the solution (following the modularity concept).
