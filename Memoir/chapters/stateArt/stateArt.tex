\chapter{State of the art}

\initial{T}he relatively recent history of ``small'' (considered as weighting less than 150 kg) commercial UAVs implies that the technologies involved have not reached a high Technology Readiness Level (TRL) \cite{assistantsecretaryofdefenseforresearchandengineering2011} until very recently, or are still under development (TRL 6-7).
For that reason, most of the work considered in the present chapter is not yet ready for the market and has a great capacity to improve.
Universities are actively exploring the autonomous aptitudes of UAVs, but the economical exploitation potential is still small due to the low reliability issues that these systems are encountering in non-controlled environments.
