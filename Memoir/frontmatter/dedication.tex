\begin{SingleSpace}
\initial{F}irstly, I would like to dedicate this thesis to my family, who have always supported me and are making a big effort to provide me with the best education.

\hspace{2em}  Secondly, a big thank you to Xin Chen, who not only was the person which I could discuss technical issues with, but also motivated me every day through her endless optimism.
Thank you also to Manuel Soler for trusting on my progress even though he was not aware of the state of the most technical parts of the project.

And last but not least, my appreciation for all my friends and classmates at UC3M, who accidentally excited me to keep working by showing their most sincere interest on the topic I was working on.
